WebSockets are a powerful technology that allows for full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection between a client and a server. They are commonly used for real-time applications where low latency and high performance are essential. Some of the common use cases for WebSockets include:

Real-time Chat Applications: WebSockets enable instant messaging and real-time updates in chat applications, eliminating the need for constant polling for new messages.

Live Feeds and Notifications: WebSockets can deliver live updates, notifications, and activity feeds to users in real-time, such as social media updates, news alerts, or live sports scores.

Financial Applications: WebSockets are employed in financial trading platforms to provide real-time updates on stock prices, market trends, and trades.

IoT (Internet of Things): WebSockets can be utilized in IoT applications for real-time monitoring and control of connected devices, enabling communication between IoT devices and central servers.

Overall, WebSockets offer a more efficient and scalable solution compared to traditional HTTP polling or long-polling techniques for real-time communication between clients and servers.
