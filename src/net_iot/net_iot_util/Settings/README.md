Should have our "base" config in the appsettings.json file. Anything that could change on different environments (in most cases connection strings for databases), you put in the environment specific appsettings.{env}.json files, depending on how many different environments you have. Also everything that comes later in the configBuilder pipeline overrides previous settings.

Wherever you host your .NET application you should be able to set the environment variable ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT or DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT to that specific environment you want to load. If neither are set, the environment defaults to Production.
