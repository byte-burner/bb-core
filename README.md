Byte Burner is a user-friendly application designed to streamline the process of flashing binary images onto a wide range of microcontroller units (MCUs). Whether you're a seasoned embedded systems engineer or a hobbyist tinkering with IoT devices, Byte Burner empowers you to effortlessly upload firmware, bootloaders, and other essential software components to your MCUs with ease and efficiency.

# Usage

Using Byte Burner is a breeze! Simply connect your bridge device (UM232H) to your laptop and select it from the dropdown menu. Next, choose a supported MCU device and the file you want to burn, then click 'Burn.' That's all there is to it! Your program should be successfully burned to the device. Why not give it a try with a simple blinky program?
