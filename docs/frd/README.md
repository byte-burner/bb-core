An FRD typically stands for "Functional Requirements Document." A Functional Requirements Document is a formal document that outlines the detailed functionality, features, and capabilities of a system, software application, or product. It serves as a guide for stakeholders, including developers, designers, and project managers, to understand what the system is expected to accomplish.

Key components of an FRD may include:

1. Introduction:
Overview of the document, its purpose, and a brief description of the project.
2. Scope:
Definition of the project's boundaries, specifying what is included and what is not.
3. Functional Requirements:
Detailed descriptions of the system's functionalities and features, often accompanied by use cases or user stories.
4. User Roles and Permissions:
Identification of different user roles and their associated permissions within the system.
5. User Interfaces:
Descriptions and mockups of the user interfaces, including screens, forms, and interactive elements.
6. Data Requirements:
Specifications for data input, processing, storage, and output.
7. System Behavior:
Details on how the system should respond to various inputs or conditions, including error handling.
8. Performance Requirements:
Criteria for system performance, such as response times, throughput, and scalability.
9. Security Requirements:
Specifications for the system's security features, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.
10. Dependencies:
Identification of external systems, libraries, or services that the system depends on.
11. Constraints:
Any constraints or limitations that may affect the development or operation of the system.
12. Assumptions and Dependencies:

Assumptions made during the development process and dependencies on other systems or components.
The Functional Requirements Document is a critical part of the software development life cycle as it provides a common understanding among stakeholders about the goals and functionalities of the system. It serves as a basis for design, development, testing, and validation activities. Additionally, it helps in tracking and managing changes to the system's requirements throughout the development process.
